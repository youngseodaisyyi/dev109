  <title>Final Q&A</title>

<body>
  <b>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b>
  <ul> 
    <li>I had no previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript other than I have heard about it before.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</b>
  <ul> 
    <li>I used the template provided from a previous module assignment because I wanted some sort of structure. I was not sure I would be able to find or create a better structure.</li>
    <li>I did add my own picture and colors to the portfolio to personalize it.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</b>
  <ul> 
    <li>The most challenging part was getting the music to play automatically when the user enters the site. It still is fickle. It seems to only work when the user revisits the home page.</li>
    <li>Another challenging part was adding the pictures for each module assignment and artifact. Simply finding pictures and linking correctly was difficult.</li>
    <li>The main image within the body of my page seems to be a set size. I cannot seem to resize it no matter what I try.</li>
    <li>I wanted to modify the three columns towards the bottom of my page for just two of my pages, but it does not look coherent if I do that.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</b>
  <ul>
    <li>I think I understand the basics of web development, so that is good.</li>
    <li>It is not as difficult or unapproachable as I thought it would be. There are some glitches and faulty situations that I dont quite understand, but overall it was a good course.</li>
    <li>There are a lot of resources online that can help troubleshoot and provide shortcuts.</li>
    <li>I liked that there are ways to validate and check for errors for the html and css.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for additional ways to solve the problem, research, and look around online for resources such as W3Schools online.</li>
    <li>Use formatting tools to help clean up the code format. Clean formatting is easier to read and easier to find problems, if any.</li>
  </ul>
